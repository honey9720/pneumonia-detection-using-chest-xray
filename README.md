# Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray

This project is a simple **machine learning application** that helps detect **pneumonia** using **chest X-ray images**. Pneumonia is a lung infection, and doctors often use X-rays to identify it. This project shows how a computer can help in that process.

The model is trained to look at chest X-ray images and classify them into two categories:

* **Normal**
* **Pneumonia**

## How it Works

* Chest X-ray images are given as input
* Images are processed and analyzed using a machine learning model
* The model predicts whether pneumonia is present or not

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Machine Learning / Deep Learning
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV

## Purpose of the Project

This project is created for **learning and academic purposes** to understand how machine learning can be applied in healthcare, especially for medical image analysis.
